# DataAnalysis

A comprehensive anomaly detection pipeline built in Python using statistical methods and machine learning models. This project walks through the full data science workflow: from exploratory data analysis to statistical profiling, Z-score filtering, PDF/PMF modeling, and a custom implementation of a Naïve Bayes classifier, all benchmarked against scikit-learn's models.

## Key Features

### Exploratory Data Analysis (Milestone 1)

- Automatic detection of data types
- Missing and infinite value detection
- Statistical summaries (mean, variance, range)
- PMF/PDF/CDF visualizations per feature
- Conditional distributions by class (normal vs anomaly)
- Joint and conditional PDFs
- Correlation heatmaps

### Statistical Outlier Detection (Milestone 2)

- Z-score based anomaly detection
- Grid search over thresholds (2.0 to 3.0)
- Performance plots for Accuracy, Precision, Recall
- PDF fitting (normal, gamma, pareto, etc.)
- PMF modeling for categorical features

### Naïve Bayes Classification (Milestone 3)

- Fully vectorized custom Naïve Bayes implementation
- Log-space optimization for underflow stability
- Support for both categorical and numerical features
- Performance comparison against:
  - GaussianNB
  - MultinomialNB
  - BernoulliNB (from scikit-learn)

## Sample Visualizations

- Histogram and KDE plots for feature distributions
- Conditional PDFs split by class
- Heatmaps for joint PMFs
- CDF overlays
- Correlation matrix of numerical fields
- Metric vs threshold performance curves
